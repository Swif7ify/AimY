**Stop Coding, Start Shooting!**

AimY is a VS Code extension that turns your idle time into aim training sessions. When you stop coding for a while, targets appear and you need to hit them to get back to work. It's like having a built-in break reminder that actually improves your mouse precision.

## What It Does

-   Detects when you're idle (configurable timer)
-   Launches a fullscreen target practice game
-   Blocks access to your code until you complete the challenge
-   Tracks your performance over time
-   Restores your workspace exactly as it was

## Features

### üéÆ Automatic Game Trigger

Takes over VS Code when you've been idle, forcing you to take an active break before continuing to code.

### üåç 2D & 3D Game Modes

Choose between classic 2D target practice or immersive 3D aim training:

-   **2D Mode**: Classic flat targets with particle effects and animations
-   **3D Mode**: Immersive 3D environment with target boards and spatial aiming

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable

-   Adjust idle timeout (default: 1 minute)
-   Set number of targets to hit (default: 5)
-   Configure target size and behavior
-   Choose between JSON or CSV stat tracking

### üìä Performance Tracking

Every game session is saved with detailed stats including accuracy, completion time, and your best streak.

### üéØ Precision Training

Moving targets, timed challenges, and accuracy scoring help improve your mouse control over time.

## Why AimY?

I built this because I noticed I'd often get stuck in long coding sessions without proper breaks. Traditional break reminders were easy to ignore, but having to actually complete a quick aim challenge before getting back to work ensures you take that mental reset.

The side benefit of improved mouse precision is just a bonus!
