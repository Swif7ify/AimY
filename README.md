**Stop Coding, Start Shooting!**

AimY is a VS Code extension that turns your idle time into aim training sessions. When you stop coding for a while, targets appear and you need to hit them to get back to work. It's like having a built-in break reminder that actually improves your mouse precision.

## What It Does

-   Detects when you're idle (configurable timer)
-   Launches a fullscreen target practice game
-   Blocks access to your code until you complete the challenge
-   Tracks your performance over time
-   Restores your workspace exactly as it was

## Features

### üéÆ Automatic Game Trigger

Takes over VS Code when you've been idle, forcing you to take an active break before continuing to code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable

-   Adjust idle timeout (default: 1 minute)
-   Set number of targets to hit (default: 5)
-   Configure target size and behavior
-   Choose between JSON or CSV stat tracking

### üìä Performance Tracking

Every game session is saved with detailed stats including accuracy, completion time, and your best streak.

### üéØ Precision Training

Moving targets, timed challenges, and accuracy scoring help improve your mouse control over time.

## Installation

1. Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EarlRomeoOrdovez.aimy&ssr=false#review-details) or search AimY directly in VSCode
2. Restart VS Code
3. The extension activates automatically
4. Start coding and wait for your first challenge!

## Quick Start

The extension works out of the box with sensible defaults. You can also:

-   Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "AimY: Start Game" to play manually
-   Click the status bar indicator to toggle auto-start on/off
-   Configure settings via File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí search "AimY"

## Configuration

All settings are available in VS Code settings under the "AimY" section:

| Setting                          | Default  | Description                                                                 |

| `aimy.idleTimer`                 | `60000`  | Idle time in milliseconds before game starts                                |
| `aimy.targetGoals`               | `5`      | Targets required to complete a session                                      |
| `aimy.targetSize`                | `100`    | Target diameter in pixels                                                   |
| `aimy.targetMove`                | `false`  | Enable moving targets                                                       |
| `aimy.targetSpeed`               | `3000`   | Movement speed (px/s)                                                       |
| `aimy.targetTimeExists`          | `3000`   | How long a target exists before counting as a miss (0 = disabled)           |
| `aimy.difficulty`                | `"normal"` | Preset difficulty: `easy`, `normal`, `hard`, `very hard`, `custom`. Choosing a preset applies tuned game parameters; `custom` uses your individual settings. |
| `aimy.statsFormat`               | `"json"` | Save format for stats: `"json"` (one file per run) or `"csv"` (append rows) |
| `aimy.statsDirectory`            | `""`     | Directory to save stats (empty = extension storage)                         |
| `aimy.enableSoundEffects`        | `true`   | Enable hit/miss sounds                                                      |

| `aimy.closeWorkspaceOnGameStart` | `true`   | Control whether open editors are closed when a game starts       

### Difficulty presets
Choose `aimy.difficulty` to quickly switch sets of parameters:
- easy ‚Äî fewer, larger, slower targets (good warmup)
- normal ‚Äî balanced default
- hard ‚Äî more, faster, smaller targets
- very hard ‚Äî extreme values for advanced training
- custom ‚Äî use the individual `aimy.*` settings you configured           |

## Why AimY?

I built this because I noticed I'd often get stuck in long coding sessions without proper breaks. Traditional break reminders were easy to ignore, but having to actually complete a quick aim challenge before getting back to work ensures you take that mental reset.

The side benefit of improved mouse precision is just a bonus!
