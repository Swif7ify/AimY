**Stop Coding, Start Shooting!**

AimY is a VS Code extension that turns your idle time into aim training sessions. When you stop coding for a while, targets appear and you need to hit them to get back to work. It's like having a built-in break reminder that actually improves your mouse precision.

## What It Does

-   Detects when you're idle (configurable timer)
-   Launches a fullscreen target practice game
-   Blocks access to your code until you complete the challenge
-   Tracks your performance over time
-   Restores your workspace exactly as it was

## Features

### üéÆ Automatic Game Trigger

Takes over VS Code when you've been idle, forcing you to take an active break before continuing to code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable

-   Adjust idle timeout (default: 1 minute)
-   Set number of targets to hit (default: 5)
-   Configure target size and behavior
-   Choose between JSON or CSV stat tracking

### üìä Performance Tracking

Every game session is saved with detailed stats including accuracy, completion time, and your best streak.

### üéØ Precision Training

Moving targets, timed challenges, and accuracy scoring help improve your mouse control over time.

## Installation

1. Install from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Restart VS Code
3. The extension activates automatically
4. Start coding and wait for your first challenge!

The extension works out of the box with sensible defaults. You can also:

## Why AimY?

I built this because I noticed I'd often get stuck in long coding sessions without proper breaks. Traditional break reminders were easy to ignore, but having to actually complete a quick aim challenge before getting back to work ensures you take that mental reset.

The side benefit of improved mouse precision is just a bonus!
